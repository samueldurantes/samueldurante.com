A common question that people have when they start reading and writing their own scripts is:

What does the following line mean?

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env python3
```

The line above is known as a shebang or hashbang. It is typically used in Unix-like operating systems to specify the interpreter that will execute the script.

In this case, we're specifying the Python 3 interpreter, but we can specify other intepreters as well. For example:

NodeJS:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env node
```

Bash:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
```
